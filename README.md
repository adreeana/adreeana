### Hi there 👋, I am Adriana. 

I am a mom and in my spare time a software engineer solving problems and building things. 

I am a runner and a [beginner chess player](https://lecavalierdelatourelle.blogspot.com/).

I love wolves, cats and [Papanasi](https://www.cuisineaz.com/recettes/papanasi-105748.aspx).
